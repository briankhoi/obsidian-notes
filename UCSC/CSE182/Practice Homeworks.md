For the midterm, work through these practice homeworks and have an LLM check it
## Practice Homework 2
1. Define the following two relational schemas in SQL using reasonable datatypes for each attribute.
	- Sells (bar, beer, price): indicates the price of each beer sold at each bar. (Note that each bar can sell many beers and many bars can sell the same beer, at possibly different prices.)
	- Frequents (drinker, bar): indicates which drinkers frequent which bars. (Note that each drinker may frequent many bars and many drinkers may frequent the same bar.)
	- Likes (drinker, beer): indicates which drinker likes which beers. (Note that a drinker may like many beers, and many drinkers may like the same beer.)
2. Add a column “size” to Sells relation schema using the “ALTER TABLE” command.
3. Write an SQL query to retrieve all beers sold by the bar “99 bottles”.
4. Write an SQL query to retrieve all beers that are priced above $3.
