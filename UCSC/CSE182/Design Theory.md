Design theory is a set of design principles that allows one to decide what constitutes a “good” or “bad” database schema design, and a set of algorithms for modifying a “bad” design to a “better”
one.

A good design depends on query workload. Sometimes we have redundancy to improve performance. 

Understanding anomalies like this is important:

model theoretic means you can prove via looking at the DB that it holds
proof theoretic is proving it via axioms
