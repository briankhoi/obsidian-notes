A database management system (DBMS) is a software system used to create, store, access, and update a database with the following qualities:
- Transactions
- High/continuous availability
- Performance
	- Response time/latency
	- Throughput
	- Scalability
- Security (authorization, etc.)

In a DBMS, users focus on *what* data is accessed, not *how* the data is accessed.

**Characteristics of a DMS:**
- Data Model: provides an abstraction of underlying data
- High Level language for manipulating data
- Transaction processing: concurrent access and updates, crash recovery
- there's a fourth one

**History of DBs:**
- 1960s: Hierarchal Data Model proposed by IBM where it was a tree-like structure
- 1970s: Relational Data model by Edgar Codd

**What is a Data Model?**
A data model is a mathematical formalism that represents the structure, operations, and constraints between data. It consists of three parts:
- Notation for describing data and mathematical objects for representing data
- A set of operations for manipulating data
	- retrieving data
	- modifying data (insert, update, delete)
- Constraints on the data
