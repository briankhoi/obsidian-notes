- Lab sections not mandatory
- Class lectures in-person, only online for special circumstances like strikes
- You can attend any lab section regardless of ones you're enrolled in
- Labs must be done individually, no code copies or online resources
- Class lectures are mandatory though, 6 in-class pop quizzes totaling 5% of overall grade, only 5 top scores count
- 4 labs and pre-labs + one final project
- Can ask AI for general ideas, but cannot ask about solution
- One page cheat sheet on midterm, two page cheat sheet on final
- Late submission = 10% penalty for each late day
- For each project, you have to submit:
	- Project demo
		- Screenshots
	- Source code
	- README file
		- How to run
		- Expected results
- The course is taught in a "top-down" approach, where we start with the application abstraction layer and make our way down to the physical nature
