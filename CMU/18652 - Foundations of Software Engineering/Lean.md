### Five Lean Principles
![[Pasted image 20250826125730.png]]
1. (Identify value) Identify what value means from perspective from your customer
2. (Map value stream) Identify all the steps of your process and eliminate the ones that do not create value
3. (Create flow) Organize the steps into a continuous flow, all the way from the original idea all the way to delivering value to the customer
4. (Implement pull) Involve the customer in deciding what needs to be built next
5. (Seek perfection) Continue until this cycle of perfect value is created with no waste

### Software Waste
Examples:
- Fixing bugs and reworking code
- Waiting for requirements before being able to implement a feature

### Kanban
#### Overview

#### Core Practices
- Visualize the workflow (e.g. kanban board)
- Limit work in progress (e.g. only 2 items can be under development column and 4 items can be selected from the backlog at once)
- Measure and optimize flow (i.e. measure average time it takes for item to go through system fully from selected to deploy/done and look for opportunities to reduce that amount of time)
- Defer commitment (commitment to implement an item is deferred until that item is selected)

This is why Kanban is useful - if the dev team had opted to take on more work, they would have increased the number of undelivered items (i.e. waste) and thus increase the overall lead time (average time from selected to deploy an item). 

#### Comparisons
Kanban is complimentary to the other practices - but it is not time boxed in iterations unlike the other. Also note we can also mix practices based on the specific needs of a project.
