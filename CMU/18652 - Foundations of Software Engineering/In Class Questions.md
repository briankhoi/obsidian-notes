In which ways are Scrum and Kanban different/similar?
1. Team Composition & Roles
	For Scrum there's Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the development team -> advocates for cross functional teams. Kanban also has cross functional teams but there are no strict requirements on team roles/what people do - it's up to the team
2. Constraints
	For Scrum, you're boxed in sprint cycles with hard deadlines (if you don't finish in time, can't extend deadline just move to next sprint). For Kanban you have a hard limit on the number of items you pull from backlog.
3. Practices
	Kanban uses a board to visualize the work in backlog, in-progress, done. Scrum has a backlog, sprint items, sprint retrospectives and sprint reviews
	also kanban principles/lean and scrum/agile manifesto
	Scrum has a burndown chart 
	Scrum has velocity aka number of story points completed each sprint - we want to maximize this
