### Agile Manifesto
We value:
- Individuals and interactions > Processes and tools
- Responding to change > Following a plan
- Customer collaboration > Contract negotiation
- Working software > Comprehensive documentation
While there is value in items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Agile is a full paradigm shift from Waterfall (all items on right are Waterfall), and a half-shift from Iterative & Incremental since it introduces the first two left bullets but second half are carried over from Iterative & Incremental
### Agile Principles

- not covered too extensively so just skip over - just putting in notes for reference
### Scrum
![[Pasted image 20250826123153.png]]
- Sprints are 2-4 weeks long
- Team is self-organized, in charge of deciding how to implement features
- Product Owner is not an actual customer, team member who represents the customer by working closely with them
- Daily standup of 15 mins to sync work
- Every sprint ends with a sprint review to demonstrate progress
- Sprint retrospective is another end of sprint event to discuss what went wrong and how to improve during the next sprint
- More of a project management framework, does not tell you how to perform technical work
- Agile values drive agile principles which drive agile practices
- Key benefit: ability to manage changing priorities
- Key barrier to adoption: inability to change organizational culture

### Extreme Programming (XP)
