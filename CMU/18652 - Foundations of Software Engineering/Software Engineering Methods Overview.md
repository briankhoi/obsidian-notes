Drawbacks
- Masks key problems until it is too late to do anything meaningful about them
- So use at your own risk

## Iterative and Incremental Approach

- Rational Unified Process (RUP)
## Agile

## Lean
![[Pasted image 20250826120059.png]]
- Focus on optimizing the end-to-end workflow from original idea to delivering product to customer
- Focus on optimizing entire workflow rather than individual processes -> reduce "waste" e.g. dev team handing code to testing team which takes 3 weeks waiting in a queue to test

## Hybrid Approach
